How to get the current Discord Loading Lines
==============
**I'm going to assume your using Chrome**

 1. [Open Discord in your Browser](https://discordapp.com/channels/@me)
Pay attention to the loading line, you'll need it later. If you miss it you can use the loading line "Managing Inventory"
 2. Open Chrome's Development Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I)
 3. Press Ctrl+Shift+F to search all files that make up Discord
 4. Type the loading line you saw. 
 5. Click the first result.
 6. Be patient. At this point it may appear the Dev Tools will freeze for a minute. There's just a lot of code to load! 
 7. At the bottom left click the **{}**
 8. Double click the highlighted line and copy!
