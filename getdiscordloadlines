How to get the current Discord Loading Lines
==============
**I'm going to assume your using Chrome**

 1. [Open Discord in your Browser](https://discordapp.com/channels/@me)
Pay attention to the loading message, you'll need it later.
 2. Open Chrome's Development Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I)
 3. Press Ctrl+Shift+F to search all files that make up Discord 
 4. Click the first result
 5. Be patient. At this point it may appear the Dev Tools will freeze. There's just a lot of code to load!
